## Description:

This project is for the 10th week homework of UCB extension fullstack coding bootcamp. I built an app to log down employees of a company to keep track of the team.

<a name="steps"></a>

## Steps:

To install you must first git clone the repo, then npm init to get the node_modules, and npm install inquirer as well as npm install jest. those are needed to run and test the code. After that, make sure you are in the develop directory and type ```node app.js``` this will run the inquirer prompts. Once all the employees are inputted it will generate your output index.html and you can view in browser.
